# Paper Illustration

Drawing figures is one of the most important and energy-consuming parts of paper writing. Compared to large blocks of text, a clear and accurate figure can often convey key information much faster. Imagine you are a paper reviewer: faced with dozens of pages, what catches your eye and helps you quickly grasp the core of the work are often just a few figures. This trend is also reflected in recent paper writing styles, where the most prominent place on the first page is often reserved for a figure showing the core innovation or experimental conclusion, instantly attracting reviewers and readers. For example:
<center><img src="../pandoc_images/doc_image1_2.png" alt=""></center>

<center><img src="../pandoc_images/doc_image2_2.png" alt=""></center>

Generally, figures in a paper can be divided into two categories: architecture/flowcharts that explain the design and core innovations, and experimental result figures that show performance comparisons. Based on this classification, I will briefly introduce the key points to note when drawing different types of figures.

## Architecture/Flowcharts

Architecture/flowcharts usually appear in the methodology section of a paper to explain the design and highlight the core innovations. There is no fixed paradigm for drawing these figures; you need to adjust flexibly according to the drawing style of papers in your field and the specific workflow of your design.

- Flowcharts: Focus on the flow of data in the scheme, connecting the workflow through data streams. For example:

<center><img src="../pandoc_images/doc_image3_2.png" alt=""></center>

<center><img src="../pandoc_images/doc_image4_2.png" alt=""></center>

- Architecture diagrams: Focus on the collaboration between modules in the scheme. For example:

<center><img src="../pandoc_images/doc_image5_2.png" alt=""></center>

<center><img src="../pandoc_images/doc_image6_2.png" alt=""></center>

Note that there is no clear boundary between flowcharts and architecture diagrams; some figures even combine both. Regardless of the type, follow these principles when drawing:

- Clear hierarchy: Divide the system into logical layers such as input, processing, and output to avoid information stacking. For example, neural network diagrams show information flow from left to right, and modules have clear boundaries (see Flowchart 1).

- Highlight the main logic: The main path should be immediately visible, while secondary details can be shown in gray or dashed lines (see Architecture Diagram 1, 2).

- Appropriate module granularity: Do not cram all details into the architecture diagram. Only key components should be marked; internal details can be explained with additional figures in the corresponding section (see Flowchart 1).

- Concise text: Module names should be short, avoiding lengthy descriptions.

- Orderly spacing: Leave reasonable spacing between modules to avoid crowding or excessive blank areas in some regions.

Recommended tools: PPT (comprehensive components and powerful functions, suitable for most architecture/flowchart drawing needs), Visio (a favorite of senior professors, often used for national fund applications; images can be embedded directly into Word documents as elements, but some designs are not user-friendly—personally, I find PPT better), other online tools (processOn, VisionOn, etc., with built-in templates, but usually require payment).

Additionally, Xiaohongshu is also a great app. By liking more research-related posts, you will be recommended more useful content in the future.

For example, a collection of framework diagram materials on Xiaohongshu: [Paper Framework Diagrams and Color Schemes](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/collection/item/67d780b00163000000000001?xhsshare=WeixinSession&appuid=618b03f7000000000202309a&apptime=1761655907&share_id=bb403df5ad954a4c809f50a832b8ae62&share_channel=wechat)

Finally, as a case, Gemini's Banana feature produces great diagrams, but you need to adjust the prompts yourself. Usually, you can use Banana to get ideas for layout and then manually draw in PPT.

## Experimental Result Figures

In the AI or LLM era, make good use of LLMs and read top conference papers to discover and "learn" how to make excellent charts.

- Tables: Screenshot the table layout you want to "learn" and send it to an LLM to generate LaTeX code. Usually, 80-90% can be reproduced, with the rest needing some manual adjustment.

- Images: Similarly, use color picking tools to "learn" the color schemes of excellent images.

Good color schemes make figures more beautiful. When reading papers, collect and learn from harmonious and beautiful color schemes using color picking tools. Here are some color palette websites:

Chart template libraries: In most cases, Python's Matplotlib library can meet most drawing needs.
