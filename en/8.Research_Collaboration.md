# Research Collaboration

The biggest problem in research is not a lack of effort, but everyone working separately, making it impossible to piece things together in the end.

Many people may not feel this, especially those used to working alone. But you must understand: **the larger the team, the harder it is to communicate, and the more problems arise in collaboration.** At this point, a clear and commonly accepted workflow is essential.

Otherwise, everyone seems busy and working hard, but when it comes to execution, everything falls apart:
- Meetings go well, but no one follows up afterward;
- Figures and conclusions in the paper don't match;
- You want to repeat an experiment but can't find the original records;
- Files pile up, but no one dares delete anything because no one knows which is the latest version.

The most troublesome part is, these issues aren't due to anyone's lack of ability, but because **everyone's work is disconnected**. Discussion, writing, experiments, and documentation—these four things should be linked, but instead become isolated blocks.

The result:
- When looking back, no one can explain why certain decisions were made;
- Newcomers have to start from scratch;
- Right before a report, you realize the data, versions, and conclusions have all diverged.

The problem isn't with the tools or the lack of manpower, but **the workflow isn't connected, and information isn't transparent**.

If a project can't connect "what's said, written, done, and recorded," then no matter how many new tools or chat groups you add, collaboration will only get messier.

On the other hand, as long as this chain is connected: discussions turn into actions, paper writing is backed by evidence, experiments can be reproduced, and documentation becomes a useful resource. Then, the team's efficiency and trust will naturally improve.

Here are four key experiences:
- How to ensure "discussed matters" are "actually executed";
- How to turn paper writing into an "efficient pipeline";
- How to make every experiment "recorded and traceable";
- And how to turn files from a "pile of documents" into a "useful knowledge base".

Tools are just helpers; workflow and habits are most important.

## Collaborative Discussion: Turning "Talked About" into "Actionable Tasks"

The most common problem in teams isn't a lack of communication, but that after communicating... nothing happens. Who will do it? To what extent? When to give feedback? No one decides.

To turn "discussion" into "action," the key is to **continue the discussion under the original topic** and have a clear beginning and end: in one discussion, clarify "evidence—who will do it—conclusion—relevant links." Afterward, **pin** the "final conclusion" or write it at the top, so newcomers immediately know "what's next."

In practice, we make it a habit to "raise issues and immediately land them." Raising a problem is no longer just "I found something," but a three-part statement: **where I'm stuck → what I've tried → who I need to do what.**

For example:

> "My experiment result A is 18% slower than expected (screenshot attached). I've ruled out hardware and power issues. Need @A to check part B, @B to review the code for part C. I'll provide comparison results and scripts for plan D by 6 PM tonight."

With this approach, others know the context when taking over. All supplementary information is replied to **in the same discussion thread**: new logs, figures, and hypotheses should not start new topics, to avoid information being scattered across multiple groups.

Once a direction is set, one person writes the "unified conclusion" in the same thread (e.g., "The cause is XX; the strategy is OO; expected effect XX; who will change code, who will update figures, who will revise the paper, and each person's deadline"), and @mentions the relevant people. Pin this conclusion so latecomers can get the full picture at a glance.

If the team is in different time zones, pay extra attention to the rhythm. We set a "response deadline" for each stuck issue (e.g., someone must reply or hand over within 24 hours), keep meetings focused and evidence-based. For short meetings, paste the discussion thread into the meeting invite; within 30 minutes after the meeting, post the minutes back to the original thread to ensure **closure**.

**Recommended tools:**
- **Domestic teams:** Use chat tools with "thread/topic" features (e.g., Feishu, DingTalk).
- **International or mixed teams:** Use Lark (Feishu international), Microsoft Teams, or Slack.

Core features: **threads** (gather discussion on one issue), **pinning** (make conclusions prominent), **insert documents/tables** (evidence at hand), **meeting minutes** (turn oral discussions into written records).

## Collaborative Writing: Build the Framework First, Then Fill Content

The hardest part of co-writing a paper isn't "writing slowly," but "everyone writing their own way": A is writing arguments, B is making figures by another standard, C is changing the format. Each person's edits make sense alone, but together they clash.

To solve this, you must first build the "skeleton" of the article: **decide what each section needs to prove**, then attach the corresponding figures, tables, and experimental data under each section. This way, the logic is clear for readers.

At the same time, the whole article should have **one unified standard**: references from the same library, consistent terminology, and uniform units and labels for figures and tables. This allows everyone to work in parallel: some adjust structure, some add evidence, some polish language. If things go off track, version comparison allows rollback.

A good collaborative state is: everyone can see each other's progress and evidence daily; if the structure changes, everyone knows and follows up the same day. Two days before submission, only finishing touches and error checks remain, not major debates.

- **Recommended tool:** Overleaf is the most common. In the early stages, you can use online docs to clarify arguments and evidence, then move to Overleaf.

## Collaborative Experimentation: Make Every Attempt "Traceable"

The most frustrating part of long-term projects is being unable to reproduce past results. What parameters changed? Which machine was used? What environment? Where are the results? If this info isn't stored with the code, handover is painful.

The only solution is to **make every experiment clearly recorded**: from "why try," to "what changed," to "what was the result," to "how to reproduce," and finally "what are the risks," all written in the same code "merge request" (MR/PR).

This way, whether it's you two weeks later or a colleague six months later, you can piece together the reasoning and evidence. Failed attempts are also recorded as "tried, didn't work," helping others avoid them.

For each experiment, write a brief explanation at the start like a research plan, and keep adding logs, figures, and reproduction commands; fix the environment (e.g., dependency lists, config files) so others can run it; if needed, roll back to the previous version.

- **Recommended tools:** Code hosting and version control (GitHub/GitLab + Git). Git manages code history; GitHub/GitLab centralizes discussion, review, automated checks, and logs for traceability.

## Knowledge Accumulation: Make It "Usable," Not Just "Piled Up"

The biggest problem with project documentation isn't that no one reads it, but that no one knows where to start. The solution is simple: **turn "files" into "usable notes."**

- Start with a **project homepage** so newcomers can understand in half an hour: what are we doing? Where are we now? What's next?
- Write each experiment as an **experiment card**: include copyable commands, configs, result figures, a one-sentence conclusion, and code location.
- Don't just drop a PDF for paper reading: summarize in three sentences what it solves, what we can learn, and what we can try today.

This way, when writing papers, you can jump from figures to experiment records, from experiment records to code, and newcomers can repeat experiments by following the "cards" without searching through chat logs and drives. At the end of a phase, archive unused notes (organize and store them), keep the links, and retrieve them anytime later.

- **Recommended tools:** Team knowledge base/online workspace (e.g., Notion, Zotero). For small teams, Notion is convenient: experiment notes, reading lists, writing progress, and meeting records can all be linked together.

In summary, collaboration isn't about forcing people together, but about smooth information flow, actionable decisions, and traceable evidence. The goal is shorter meetings, more reliable writing, smoother handovers, and faster onboarding for newcomers. Any tool is fine as long as you focus on the core: discussions should be threaded, writing should allow multi-person editing, and experiments and documentation should be traceable.
