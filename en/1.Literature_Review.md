# Literature Review

First, it is important to clarify the purpose of a literature review. Generally, a literature review aims to establish a foundational understanding of a research field, including the research questions, methods, hotspots, and trends within the target area. This process helps you determine your own research direction and lays the groundwork for paper reading and subsequent work. If a master's or PhD program aims to make you an expert in the field, mastering and practicing literature review can make you "look like an expert" in the field.

The literature review process can be roughly divided into three parts: finding papers, organizing papers, and tracking academic progress.

## Finding Papers

In the first stage of finding papers, most people do not have a specific research direction and are exploring within the lab's research area. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly build a basic understanding of the field. At this point, it is recommended to prioritize searching for review papers and some excellent doctoral dissertations, as these are information-dense and often subdivide the field further. Keywords for reviews include "survey" and "review".

While reading, you should not only learn about outstanding achievements in the field but also sense the development trends and the pros and cons of various research methods. Organizing these insights into notes is a good practice. It is recommended to focus on recording key papers in the field and to note down certain keywords for future literature searches.

The second stage involves a deeper analysis of one or several subfields, using multiple keywords to search for papers and collecting high-relevance, high-quality papers for in-depth reading.

Note: If there are senior students in your lab working in the same field, you can ask them to recommend relevant reviews and key papers. Some mature labs may even have their own literature databases. Communicating with them is also an important part of academic life.

Common literature search tools include:

- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/): You can find almost all the papers, books, preprints, and patents you need (in English). Note that Google Scholar does not provide access to the papers themselves but only indexes and links. Sometimes, you can find a free PDF among the multiple versions of a paper. Common search tips:

  - Directly search keywords: including title, ISBN/ISSN, DOI, etc. Spaces act as "AND" (all keywords must be satisfied).

  - Use quotes "" for exact phrase searches.

  - Advanced search: Besides remembering common Google Scholar syntax, you can use its built-in advanced search, which supports searching by journal/conference name, as shown below:

- [Aminer](https://www.aminer.cn/): Aminer's main advantage is its user-friendly interface for Chinese users, journal/conference ranking filters, and various literature tracking features. The downside is that its paper index is not as comprehensive as Google Scholar. Useful features include:

  - Keyword/scholar/journal subscriptions to track the latest papers:

- Beginner-friendly journal filtering:

- [wispaper](https://www.wispaper.ai/): AI-based search tool, useful as an auxiliary tool.

- [CNKI](https://www.cnki.net/): Good for searching Chinese master's and doctoral theses and patents.

- [connectedpapers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/): Visualizes paper relationships, helping you quickly find related papers in a field based on one paper.

- SCIHub: If you cannot download a paper due to copyright, you can try searching for a free PDF on SCIHub using the DOI. The website address may change, so search for the latest one on Google.

## Organizing Papers

The three parts of literature review are deeply intertwined. Organizing papers means saving highly relevant papers or reviews to your own literature database. Information to save includes (but is not limited to): paper title, year, PDF link, open-source code link, etc. When building your own database, it is best to summarize each paper in one sentence for quick recall later. For literature management tools, besides the popular Zotero, I also use a simpler method—spreadsheets.

- Zotero's browser plugin helps quickly import papers locally, parsing most information and serving as a reading tool.

- I also use online spreadsheets for organizing papers because they are intuitive and convenient. I use Feishu's smart spreadsheets, with columns for title, publication date, authors, institution, journal/conference name, ranking, abstract, summary, PDF, and code link. Different sheets record papers, open-source tools, and online resources in different directions.

## Tracking Academic Progress

"Learning alone without friends leads to ignorance and narrow-mindedness." In academic life, we also need to track the latest developments. Common methods include:

- Twitter (X): Many researchers share their latest work on social media. By following and interacting with key figures, you will see more relevant content.

- Arxiv: Many people upload preprints before submitting to journals/conferences. As an open-access digital system, it covers many disciplines, with a high frequency of AI-related papers. Recommended [MyArxiv](https://github.com/MLNLP-World/MyArxiv) project for daily updates, and [zotero-arxiv-daily](https://github.com/TideDra/zotero-arxiv-daily) for AI-powered recommendations.

![descript](../pandoc_images/doc_image6.png)

- Academic conference/journal announcements: Regularly check for the latest conference/journal results, especially for top venues in your field, and read the latest work.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/): Follow academic labs or key researchers to see their starred or open-sourced repositories. Searching with the "awesome" keyword can also find curated paper collections, e.g.:

![descript](../pandoc_images/doc_image7.png)

- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/trending): After Papers with Code was discontinued, Hugging Face launched the Trending Papers section, mainly for AI papers.

![descript](../pandoc_images/doc_image8.png)

- [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/): Like an academic social network, but not as user-friendly. Following users lets you see their paper updates.

- [Aminer](https://www.aminer.cn/): As mentioned above, you can subscribe to keywords, scholars, journals, and institutions.

- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com): As the name suggests.

- RSS: Some personal blogs support RSS, allowing you to track their latest posts. Recommended RSSHub plugin; any reader will do.

- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/): Google Scholar also offers email alerts for new papers by followed authors or search results. Notably, after Gemini 3 Pro was released, Google Scholar added academic labs and paper push features.

- Zhihu/WeChat public accounts: Good for casual academic browsing and keeping up with new developments in various computer science fields.

Explanation of computer science conference/journal rankings:

In computer science, the CCF recommended list and CAS divisions are often mentioned. There are also "top conferences/journals" in each field, e.g., the four top security conferences: CCS, NDSS, S&P, and USENIX Security.

- CCF: Issued by the China Computer Federation, classifies journals and conferences into A, B, and C levels.

- JCR: Issued by Clarivate, ranks journals into four categories based on citation data.

- CAS: Issued by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also divides into four categories, though some lists are controversial.

Note: SCI (Science Citation Index) is a literature database created by ISI. "Divisions" refer to the ranking of SCI journals by impact factor (IF) to evaluate academic influence more precisely.

Recommended tools:

- [CCFDDL](https://ccfddl.com/): Check CCF conference deadlines (also has a mini-program) and [domestic version](https://ccfddl.cn/).

- [MyHuiban](https://www.myhuiban.com/): Search for conference rankings and deadlines.

- [call4paper](https://www.call4papers.cn/ccf/ccf-1.html): Search for CCF rankings and deadlines (also has a WeChat account and mini-program).

Tool recommendations:

- easyScholar: Chrome extension that shows conference rankings in search results. Downside: CCF dataset is not free.

- [CCFrank](https://github.com/WenyanLiu/CCFrank4dblp): Open-source Chrome extension
- [ExCITATION journal ranking in Google Scholar](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/excitation-journal-rankin/aolbomhlimkdakklifkocohcgpmojdia): Chrome extension for viewing JCR rankings

Note: Besides traditional full papers, academic conferences also accept other forms such as short papers, demo papers, technical briefs, position papers, workshop papers, and poster abstracts. These are generally less recognized than regular conference papers.
