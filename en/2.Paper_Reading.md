# Paper Reading

**What is learned from books is superficial after all; one must practice to truly understand. All content here is for reference only; specific implementation should be adapted to the situation.**

> This article is mainly a translation of "How to read a paper," combined with some experiences from other predecessors.

> The Zhihu article "How to Read a Paper" not only introduces the "three-pass" paper reading method, but also cites a considerable amount of experience from predecessors. It provides a very detailed introduction to different paper reading methods for various situations, as well as how to conceive ideas. Highly recommended.

The main purposes of reading papers are:

1.  To understand the current state and development trends of a research field
2.  To inspire and conceive your own research ideas

Therefore, researchers spend a considerable amount of time reading papers. However, reading an article from beginning to end is extremely time-consuming and laborious, and is not advisable.

Drawing on the thoughts of predecessors, the "three-pass" paper reading method is introduced here.

> Each reading should achieve a specific goal, and each reading builds upon the previous one.

## The first pass

> Core: Understand the general idea of the paper (what, why, and where are the contributions)

**How to do it:**

1.  Read the title, abstract, introduction, each section heading (ignore the details), and conclusion
2.  Browse the references and mark the works you have read

After completing the above, you should be able to answer the following five questions (**five Cs**):

1.  Category: What type of paper is this?
2.  Context: What related work is there? What theoretical background is needed to analyze the problem in the paper?
3.  Correctness: Are the assumptions in the paper valid?
4.  Contributions: What are the main contributions of the paper?
5.  Clarity: Did the authors clearly and logically convey their research?

After the first pass, you should have an understanding of what problem the paper addresses. At this point, you can judge whether the paper is valuable for your research and whether it is worth further reading.

The goal of this layer is to **establish an overall impression and determine whether it is worth investing time for deeper reading**.

## The second pass

> Core: Understand the main technical content and reasoning, without pursuing all details (proofs, code, mathematical derivations)

How to do it:

1.  Carefully examine the figures and tables in the paper, and check for common errors (are the axes correctly labeled? Are the results reliable and **statistically significant?**)
2.  Mark the works in the references that you are not familiar with (a good way to further understand the background of the paper)

After completing the above, you should be able to grasp the main content of the paper (what is proposed, why it is done, what is used, and what are the results), **be able to clearly summarize the core ideas of the paper to others**, and support your description with evidence from the paper.

If you still cannot understand the main content of the paper after completing the above, there may be several reasons:

1.  Unfamiliarity with the topic, terms, and abbreviations
2.  The authors use unfamiliar proof methods or experimental techniques
3.  Poor writing quality, unsupported assertions, and frequent forward references
4.  ~~You are tired~~

At this point, you can choose to:

1.  Put the paper aside and ~~hope you never need to understand it in your research career~~
2.  Read it later, for example after learning more background information
3.  Continue to the third pass

## The third pass

Core: Fully understand a piece of work

Original words from the paper: **[The key to the third pass is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work.]{.underline}**

By comparing the re-creation with the actual work, you can find the innovations, hidden shortcomings, and assumptions in the work.

How to do it: Read every detail carefully, discover and question every assumption in the author's arguments. Think about how to express your own views, deeply understand the paper's reasoning, proof methods, and writing skills. During this reading, you should also record future research directions and ideas for improvement that come to mind.

After completing the third pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper, clearly point out its strengths and weaknesses, discover hidden assumptions and important related work not cited by the authors, and critically evaluate its methods, arguments, and writing skills.

Generally, it is necessary to take notes after reading a paper. In the author's opinion, paper notes should not only include your own expression of the work (not mandatory), but also record what you have learned from the paper (writing skills, idea conception, system design, experimental design, etc.), and other elements as needed.

The form and type of notes are diverse. As long as you follow the principle of recording understanding and facilitating review, you can choose any format.

## Example

Here is an example of reading the paper "How to read a paper."

### The first pass

First, we read the title, abstract, introduction, section headings, and conclusion. We realize that this paper mainly introduces a method for reading papers. Then we read the references. Unfortunately, we have not read any of the referenced works, so we do not mark any.

After the first pass, let's answer the five questions: This paper is introductory, has three related works, and requires no theoretical background to read. The paper makes no assumptions and clearly expresses the work.

After thinking, this paper helps us learn how to read papers, is valuable to us, and is worth reading.

### The second pass

Next, we look at the figures and tables in the paper. There are none, so we move on. All the references are works we have not read, so we mark them all.

After the second pass, let's try to grasp the structure of the paper: The paper first points out the importance of reading papers and the necessity of reading them effectively. The second section introduces the three steps of the THREE-PASS method in order, including the goals of each step. The third section mainly introduces how to find papers worth reading. The fourth experimental section mainly describes the author's own experience (from the section headings, we can infer the main idea of each paragraph).

Here we find that we seem to be able to summarize the content of the paper, so we proceed directly to the third pass.

### The third pass

In the last pass, we read the paper in depth. The content before the example section in this article can be regarded as the analysis and summary of the third pass. After reading the entire paper, we find that the method introduced in this paper is more suitable for reading specific works rather than review articles. The paper clearly introduces the approach for each pass, and there is an experimental section. The overall structure is complete.

Summary: This paper can guide us in mastering ways to read papers and cites works on how to review articles and write scientific papers.

## Recommended Tools

- [alphaxiv](https://www.alphaxiv.org/): Use LLM to quickly read papers on arXiv
- [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/): A literature management and reading tool with a rich plugin ecosystem

The author uses zotero for literature management. Zotero has two ways of categorization: collection and tag. The author uses collection to represent the field involved in the literature, and tag to represent the specific technology applied. For example, for the paper "SSFuzz: State-Guided Fuzzing With Shared Feedback for Black-Box IoT Devices," the author puts it in the IoT group and tags it as Fuzz.

Here are some zotero plugins commonly used by the author:

1.  Better BibTex for Zotero: Convenient for exporting references
2.  Ethereal Style: Can set styles (the commonly used ones should be the tag function and note function)
3.  Zotero Focused Mode: Can hide the navigation bar for immersive reading
4.  Zotero Reading List: Can set the literature to five different states (New, To Read, In progress, Read, Not Reading), so you no longer have to worry about forgetting which papers you have read

It is highly recommended to use zotero's browser plugin for one-click import, which is really convenient.
