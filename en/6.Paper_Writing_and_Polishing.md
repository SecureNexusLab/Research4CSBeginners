# Paper Writing and Polishing

This section mainly organizes some excellent guidance on writing in the computer science field and shares some of the pitfalls and experiences we have encountered in actual paper writing.

## [The Lifecycle of a Paper (or Research Project) & The Importance of Papers]

![descript](../pandoc_images/doc_image2.svg)

Above is a common lifecycle of a research project. As shown, papers are an important part of research, often taking up 50% (or even more) of our total work time. Sometimes, even relatively ordinary work can be published at good conferences after being well-packaged during the writing process. Papers are a crucial way to showcase our achievements, and from a practical perspective, publishing papers is often a graduation requirement for both schools and advisors. In any case, getting your paper published (or "marketed") is very important. Especially in recent years, with the expansion of graduate and doctoral admissions, the number of submissions to journals and conferences has increased significantly. "Good wine also fears a deep alley"—a well-written paper can greatly improve your acceptance rate.

## [Excellent Sharing and Guidance on Paper Writing]

Many experienced researchers have already shared their insights and guidance on writing in their respective fields online. In this section, we briefly introduce some outstanding resources and **strongly recommend** that you **watch the original videos** or **read the original documents**. You will definitely learn a lot from them.

1. Professor Shui Yu's "High-Quality Scientific Paper Writing". [**https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hg4y1q7Ge**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hg4y1q7Ge)

Professor Shui Yu explains key points in paper writing from the perspective of a reviewer. He also introduces several key elements and considerations in paper writing, and gives advice on research methods and daily research habits.

2. "Basic Literacy in Graphics and Vision Research". [**https://pengsida.net/games003/**](https://pengsida.net/games003/)

This is a very systematic introductory course covering all aspects of the research process and good research habits. Although it is a course for the graphics and vision field, it is also very helpful for students in other computer science directions to get through the novice period. You don't have to watch it all at once; some later chapters, such as "Paper Rebuttal Strategies" and "Academic Presentation Preparation," can be watched when needed.

3. Log of Comments on Writing. [**staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~soung/LogWriting.pdf**](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~soung/LogWriting.pdf)

If the above two tutorials provide guidance from a higher level, this book is more down-to-earth. It compiles typical problems Chinese students encounter when writing English scientific papers, as well as common English writing errors and improvement suggestions collected by the author over years of guiding students. At the beginning stage, you can even use it as a dictionary. It is highly recommended to read it carefully before you start writing, which will make your advisor less stressed when revising your paper (just kidding).

## **[Paper Writing Experience Sharing]**

Next, based on our own writing experience, we share some pitfalls and lessons learned in paper writing, hoping to help everyone.

### 1. Time Allocation for Paper Writing

For students writing a paper for the **first time**, based on our lab's (system security direction) submission experience in recent years, it usually takes 3 weeks to 1 month to complete a paper draft (to a level that the advisor can review). First-time writers often **overestimate** their abilities, especially those with weaker English skills. Therefore, it is highly recommended to reserve enough time for writing and optimizing the content and figures after determining the submission deadline.

Note: In the LLM era, almost everyone uses LLMs to assist with writing, which greatly lowers the threshold for English writing. However, LLMs are not omnipotent and still have some issues, which will be discussed in the next section.

### 2. A High-Level Guiding Principle: "Done is Better than Perfect"

When starting to write a paper, most students fall into the trap of trying to make every part "perfect" in the **first draft**—from wording and formula layout to figure arrangement and color schemes, sometimes spending hours polishing. A reality check: unless you are exceptionally talented, even the most "perfect" draft in your eyes will be marked with many revisions by your advisor. Some paragraphs you painstakingly revised may be silently marked "delete" by your advisor.

Therefore, the most important thing in paper writing is not to aim for "perfection" in the first draft, but to **finish the entire paper as soon as possible**.

Completing a "readable, reviewable, and discussable" draft is the starting point for any paper. Only when you put your ideas and story into words can you truly discover logical flaws, core selling points, and experimental shortcomings. Many problems you thought existed may resolve themselves once written out; ideas you thought were perfect may reveal many issues once on paper. **Writing itself is part of thinking, not just the result of thinking.**

Also, our papers are reviewed by reviewers, who care more about the clarity of your logic, the significance of your research question, the reasonableness of your methods, and whether your results support your conclusions—not about how beautiful your sentences are or how pretty your figures are (though they should at least be presentable). We should finish the first draft as soon as possible, then review the whole paper from a "God's-eye view" to improve the logic, structure, and experiments. Only after that, in the final stage before submission, should we optimize the language and figures.

There is a saying in paper writing: "Good papers are revised, not written." **Finish first, then perfect.** Almost every published paper starts from an "imperfect draft"—dare to start, dare to finish, dare to revise.

### 3. Paper Writing Tools

#### 3.1 Choice of Writing Tools

For students in computer-related majors, LaTeX is almost always used for paper writing; Word or other tools are rarely used.

**Online LaTeX Editor**: **Overleaf** is an online LaTeX editor and is almost the first choice.

**Local LaTeX Editor**: You can also set up a local LaTeX environment, such as TeX Live & TeXstudio, to compile LaTeX documents locally (installation tutorials are easy to find online; as a CS graduate student, you should have some search and hands-on skills).

#### 2. Suggestions for Learning LaTeX Syntax

If you have participated in mathematical modeling competitions during your undergraduate studies, you should be familiar with LaTeX.

If you are a beginner and have never used LaTeX, it is recommended to first systematically learn and understand its basic concepts, such as commands and environments. Then learn the document structure, common basic syntax, commands, and how to use BibTeX to manage references, which will cover most of your needs. More advanced features, such as drawing complex tables or custom commands, can be learned as needed later.

For learning LaTeX syntax, you can ask an LLM or watch some video tutorials on Bilibili, such as ["Beginner's LaTeX Typesetting Tutorial"](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV117w5eyEXv) or other courses—choose one that suits you.

**Some Tips:**

1. It is recommended to compile after writing a little, especially when dealing with complex content like tables. This helps catch syntax errors early and saves time debugging later. A small complaint: Overleaf's error messages are not very friendly, so if you get stuck, ask an LLM for help.

2. Another suggestion: do the final typesetting after the content is mostly finalized; otherwise, tables and figures may move around, making your previous typesetting work invalid.

**Other Tips**: If your paper needs a major revision, you usually need to submit a diff version to show what changes were made. In this case, latexdiff is a very useful tool. If you have installed a local LaTeX environment like TeX Live, it already includes this tool, which can be used directly from the command line. There are also online latexdiff websites, such as: [Latexdiff-web](https://latexdiff.cn/).

### 4. Common Structure of Papers

Different journals and conferences have different requirements, and official templates are usually provided. Use their templates directly.

The structure of papers also varies by field. Below is a common structure:

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Background & Challenge or Motivation
- Design
- Evaluation
- Discussion or Threats to Validity
- Related Work
- Conclusion
- Reference

Among these, Abstract and Introduction are the most important, as they often determine the reviewer's first impression.

A brief introduction to some sections:

#### Abstract & Introduction

> Strongly recommend watching Professor Shui Yu's original video "High-Quality Scientific Paper Writing"; the following is just a summary.

Simply put, the Introduction is a summary of the rest of the paper, and the Abstract is a summary of the Introduction.

A typical **Introduction** should answer the following questions:

1. What problem does this paper address, and why is it important (show citations and reasons)?
2. What are the current solutions (cite to show you know the field)?
3. What are the shortcomings of current solutions (state positively)?
4. What is our solution and its advantages?
5. What are the contributions of this paper? Convince reviewers what you did, why, and the results (benefits).
6. (Optional) Structure of the paper.

The Abstract goes further: state the problem in one sentence, briefly describe the method or system design, give main results, and emphasize contributions and significance.

#### Background & Challenge or Motivation

This section should provide necessary theoretical background and existing technologies, highlight current limitations and challenges, and explain why these challenges need to be addressed, leading to your research motivation.

### Design & Evaluation

In the Design section, describe your method, system, or model architecture in detail, usually with flowcharts or framework diagrams. Emphasize how your design addresses current limitations and challenges.

In the Evaluation section, introduce the experimental environment, data sources, evaluation metrics, design different comparison experiments (yours vs. others), show data results, and analyze them (why the results are as they are, why they are better, reasons for anomalies, etc.).

Both sections involve scientific plotting, which is covered in the **Scientific Plotting** chapter.

#### Discussion or Threats to Validity

Discuss the strengths and limitations of your method. If your paper has unavoidable limitations, be sure to write them in the Limitation section, or reviewers will point them out in their reviews.

#### Related Work & Reference

Introduce recent and classic works related to yours. Try to cite top conferences and journals, and avoid citing low-quality work, as it may lower your paper's perceived quality. References should serve your paper's story; don't cite irrelevant work.

References are usually managed with BibTeX.

- DBLP: [dblp: computer science bibliography](https://dblp.org/)
  
  DBLP is commonly used in computer science to get BibTeX citations.

- Sometimes you may need to cite open-source tools or websites. There are online citation generators, such as: [Web Citation Generator](https://web.funnysaltyfish.fun/link2ref/page), which you can modify as needed.

#### Threat Model

In security papers, the threat model is a core component. It defines: "Who is the attacker, what can they do, what can't they do." The threat model clarifies the research scope, establishes reasonable assumptions, and facilitates comparison with other research.

Common elements include: attacker's goals, motivation, capabilities, accessible information, attack surface, etc. For defense designs, trust assumptions are also needed.

Example from a CCS 2024 Distinguished Paper:

```plaintext
Threat Model. In our threat model, the attacker aims to steal users’ identities on target websites, thereby gaining unauthorized access. This occurs when a user logs into the attacker’s (malicious) website using Web3 authentication. The attacker exploits this opportunity to steal the user’s identity (signature) of the target website. In our model, the attacker cannot exploit browser vulnerabilities or crack users’ crypto wallets. Also, attackers cannot intercept and decrypt network packets, such as man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. The attacker’s capabilities are limited to exploiting vulnerabilities in the Web3 authentication process of the target website.
```

## LLM-Assisted Paper Writing

In the LLM era, the language barrier for English paper writing has been significantly lowered, but some issues remain, especially for those with weak English skills.

First, students with weak English usually write in Chinese first, then use LLMs to translate into English. The quality of the translation largely depends on the quality of the Chinese content. If the Chinese logic is messy, the English translation will be worse. A useful tip is to first let the LLM organize your Chinese logic and sentences, then translate to English—this works much better than direct translation.

Second, LLMs sometimes use words that are uncommon in academic writing, even if the meaning is similar. It's easy to feel that LLM-generated content is better than your own, but it's hard to judge if it's really appropriate (whether it truly expresses your meaning, uses the right technical terms, etc.). For those with weak English or little writing experience, it's hard to tell if the words are correct. The previously mentioned Log of Comments on Writing can be a reference. For technical terms, you can prepare a glossary and require the LLM to use those terms during translation.

Third, avoid long and complex sentences from LLMs. Academic writing should be concise, using short sentences. As a rule of thumb: in a double-column template, if a sentence exceeds 5 lines, split it. Also, don't give the LLM a whole long paragraph at once; translate in small sections, and explicitly ask for sentence-by-sentence translation for easier checking. A useful method is "back-translation": if you're unsure whether the LLM's English expresses your meaning, use another translation tool (preferably a traditional engine like DeepL or Google Translate) to translate the English back to Chinese. If the back-translation is logical and unchanged, the English is accurate.

Finally, you can use tools like Grammarly to check the grammar of LLM-generated content.

#### Improving Your Own English Skills Is Also Important

Although LLMs can help a lot with language, improving your own English is still important. After your paper is accepted, you will need to give oral presentations and poster sessions in English. LLMs can't do that for you, and during poster sessions, foreign researchers will communicate with you in English. If you need live translation, it will seem unprofessional.

Some recommendations for improving academic English:
